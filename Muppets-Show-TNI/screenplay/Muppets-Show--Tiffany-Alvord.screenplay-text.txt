Kermit: it is great having you here, Tiffany.

Tiffany: thanks, Kermit; I'm having a great time, too.

Kermit: nice! You know, Tiffany, you have that good girl image.

Tiffany: yes, I know. "Jedi in the streets" / etc.

+++: But I do have a "bad girl" and a "badass" sides to my personality. I
also tend to get cast into many kissing roles.

Kermit: it has been said that men would kill to kiss you.

Tiffany: well, if I like the screenplay enough, then the production company
can also pay the guys I kiss on screen.
