<s id="talk_with_tiffany" title="Talking with Tiffany">

Kermit: it is great having you here, Tiffany.

Tiffany Alvord: thanks, Kermit; I'm having a great time, too.

Kermit: I'm happy you do.

+++: You know, Tiffany, you have that good girl image.

Tiffany: yes, I know. "Jedi in the streets" / etc.

+++: But I do have a "bad girl" side and a "badass" side to my personality. I
also tend to get cast into many kissing roles.

Kermit: it has been said that men would kill to kiss you.

Tiffany: heh, figuratively, I hope.

+++: Anyway, if I like the screenplay enough, then the production company
can even also pay the guys I kiss on screen.

[<a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Gonzo">Gonzo</a> appears swiftly.]

Gonzo: hey, Tiff… can we kiss for the money? It's in the script.

Tiffany: sure, Gonzo. On a countdown from 3:

+++: three… two … one … [ she kisses Gonzo ].

[ <a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Scooter">Scooter</a> (= a muppet gofer) approaches. ]

Scooter: here's your 500,000 dollars in thousand dollar bills, Gonz.

Gonzo: why, thanks! [he thinks for a moment] Say: can we kiss again?

[

Tiffany puts her head in her palm, shakes her head and sighs.

Animal: Tiffany kiss Animal!

[ <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Discord">Discord (MLP)</a> pops
up out of thin air. ]

Discord: hey, why does everypony get to kiss Tiffany, and I don't?

Animal: Animal not a pony!

Tiffany: hold your ponies, guys! These kisses are not in the script.

+++: But let's do something else that's fun: let's play basketball!

The others: alright!

<s id="playing-basketball" title="Playing basketball">

Kermit: [holding a microphone] and here we are in Venice Beach, California,
as the Muppets' basketball team, which consists of Tiffany Alvord, Gonzo
the Great, Discord, Animal, and… <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/nav-blocks/blocks/#harry_potter_nav_block">Emma Watson</a>.

Emma Watson: Tiffany, Discord, and I are honorary Muppets.

Animal: honorary Muppets!

Kermit: yes… anyway, they are playing against… the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a>.

LA Lakers’ Captain: ok - timeout, timeout! The other Lakers and I are professional players. We’ve been practising for years, often several hours a day. Moreover, you are… how should I put it…

Animal: muppets basketballers shorter than Lakers!

LA Lakers’ Captain: exactly! So while it isn't unthinkable this will be a fair match (given I just thought about it), it seems unlikely that it it is going to be one.

Emma Watson: no worries! I'm not in the mood to play now anyhow, so I'll summon my backup player.

+++: [uses her phone] hey Big Puff! please come to replace me.

Big Puff: let's play ball!

Tiffany, Discord, and the Captain: bloody fuck!

Emma Watson: hey, that's my line!

Tiffany: guys, I think I'd rather the script would tell me to kiss you.

LA Lakers’ Captain: it seems unlikely that it it is going to be a fair match again.

Animal: not fair match, not fair match!
