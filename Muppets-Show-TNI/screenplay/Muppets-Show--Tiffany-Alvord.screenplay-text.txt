<s id="talk_with_tiffany" title="Talking with Tiffany">

Kermit: it is great having you here, Tiffany.

Tiffany: thanks, Kermit; I'm having a great time, too.

Kermit: nice! You know, Tiffany, you have that good girl image.

Tiffany: yes, I know. "Jedi in the streets" / etc.

+++: But I do have a "bad girl" and a "badass" sides to my personality. I
also tend to get cast into many kissing roles.

Kermit: it has been said that men would kill to kiss you.

Tiffany: heh, figuratively, I hope.

+++: Anyway, if I like the screenplay enough, then the production company
can also pay the guys I kiss on screen.

[<a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Gonzo">Gonzo</a> appears swiftly.]

Gonzo: hey Tiff… can we kiss for the money? It's in the script.

Tiffany: sure, Gonzo. On a countdown from 3:

+++: three… two … one … [ she kisses Gonzo ].

[ Scooter approaches. ]

Scooter: here's your 500,000 dollars in thousand dollar bills, Gonz.

Gonzo: why, thanks! [he thinks for a moment] Say: can we kiss again?

[

Tiffany puts her head in her palm, shakes her head and sighs.
