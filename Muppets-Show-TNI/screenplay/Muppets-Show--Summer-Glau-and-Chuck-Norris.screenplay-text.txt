<s id="meet_chuck" title="“Meet Chuck”">

[The Muppet Show Theatre backstage. Kermit and Fozzy are there.

ChuckN enters through the door.
]

Kermit: Oh hello, Mr. Norris. We’re so glad to have you here, and we would
love to learn more about you.

ChuckN: Thank you, Kermit. You can learn more about me from my 500-page
autobiography, which took me an hour to write, and from the comprehensive
book of Factoids about me, of which I wrote every one.

Fozzy: Funny! Funny!

ChuckN: Indeed. Anyway, I invited a friend of mine, who is even crazier than I
am, to join us.

Kermit: Really, who is this crazy guy?

ChuckN: Actually, it’s a crazy girl.

[SGlau jumps from above the frame to the upper row and then down to where
Kermit and Fozzy are standing. Applause. She is wearing a grey, military-style
vest with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper">zipper</a> at
the front.]

Kermit: Oh, nice to see you here, Ms. Glau.

SGlau: Shut up, Mr. Frog! I’m here on a mission from the Grammar God. Herr
Norris and I are loyal servants of Grammar Nazism, which aims to unite Grammar
Europe under the reign of the Third Grammar Reich.

ChuckN and SGlau: [in unison] Hail Grammar!

[Miss Piggy is walking along the upper row with a fellow pig.]

Miss Piggy: Well, I don’t think that Miss Mousy is prettier than me.

[A shot sounds and Miss Piggy's hat is blown away. Cut to SGlau, who is
holding a gun in her left hand.]

SGlau: That was a warning shot, Fräulein Piggy. For your information, it should
be “is prettier than <b>I</b>”.

ChuckN and SGlau: [in unison] Hail Grammar!

SGlau: Let’s go.

+++: By the way, herr Frog: it is not that hard to be green.

[They go out of the frame.]

Kermit: Meep. I have a bad feeling about all that.

<s id="kicking_ass_grammar_nazi_style" title="Kicking ass Grammar Nazi Style">

[Congregation of evil muppets (including
<a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Moopets">the Moopets</a>) with
Grammar Nazi uniforms. SGlau and ChuckN are on the stage.

SGlau fires a gun in the air. The room falls silent.]

SGlau: Hail Grammar!

[The Grammar Nazi muppets respond.]

SGlau: Grammar Europe is quickly being conquered by the forces of the noble
Grammar Nazism.

+++: Together we have punished all the miserable souls who have used the
despicable neologism “a software” instead of “a program” or “a software
application”.

["Hail Grammar" from the audience.]

SGlau: Now, Herr Norris and I shall demonstrate how to further kick ass grammar
style.

[SGlau pulls two guns and ChuckN holds two micro-Uzis.]

SGlau: Observe.

[Sudden quick shots as someone shoots all the guns out of SGlau and ChuckN's
hands and those of the rest of the Grammar Nazi muppets.]

SGlau: What the hell?

Lucky Luke: Change of plans, Miss Glau [chews some gum.]

SGlau: And who might you be, Herr…

Lucky Luke: Luke, Ma'am! Lucky Luke. I'm the Grammar Reichsfuhrer personal
henchman.

SGlau: [startled] Hail Grammar!

[Everyone joins.]

Lucky Luke: Indeed. There is a change of plans so they sent me here.

+++: Miss Glau, Mr. Norris and you must travel undercover to the evil
State of California, where you will start the startup “Venting is us.” to
battle the growing infestation of bad grammar on social Internet media. You
will receive funding from the Grammar Nazi Gestapo.

+++: Is that clear?

SGlau: Of course, we’ll do anything for the noble Grammar Reich!

+++: Hail Grammar!

[Applause. Cut.]

You can't touch her,<br />
You can't touch her!

With a mind to see and two good eyes.

Any man on the planet will lose his frown,<br />

So move, outta your seat<br />
That fly girl will make you catch this beat

Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going' on<br />

Making' 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving' 'em<br />
Now, they know<br />
You talking' about the Hammer, you talking' about a show

Singers are sweating' so pass them a wipe<br />
Or a tape, to learn<br />
What's it gonna take in the nineties to burn

That's word because you know<br />
You can't touch this, you can't touch this

Stop, Hammer time

+++: Go with the funk, it is said<br />
If you can't groove to this<br />

Run your fingers through your hair

Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner<br />

With others making' records that just don't hit<br />
I've toured around the world, from London to Dubai<br />
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo, Hammer"<br />
And the rest can go and play

+++: You can't touch this<br />
You can't touch this<br />
You can't touch this

+++: Yeah, you can't touch this<br />
I told you, you can't touch this<br />
Too hype, can't touch this<br />
Get way outta here, you can't touch this

<s id="venting_is_us" title="“Venting Is Us.”">

[A modern tech office whose door says: “Venting is Us.” with a large version
of <a href="http://xkcd.com/406/">xkcd: “Venting”</a>. ChuckN and SGlau are
sitting inside.]

ChuckN: OK, Summer, I finished writing another rebuttal, as whom should I sign
it?

SGlau: How about as
<a href="http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Rory_Gilmore">Rory Gilmore</a>?

ChuckN: Sounds good. You can sign yours as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Love_Hewitt">Jennifer Love Hewitt</a>.

SGlau: Cool.

[A few muppets who look like Mafios storm in.]

Head Mafio: Are you Summer Glau and Chuck Norris?

SGlau and ChuckN: [Startled] Yes, we are.

Head Mafio: Well, I am seeking vengeance on a blog comment the two of you wrote
and signed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany
Alvord</a>, so we are going to wack up this office.

SGlau: Using <a href="http://xkcd.com/322/">Electro-Magnetic
Pulse (EMP) Cannons</a>?

Head Mafio: No, using these machine guns! [Mafio muppets showing their machine
guns.]

[ChuckN and SGlau quickly raise their hands.]

SGlau: Ahem... may I consult with Chuck for a moment or two?

Head Mafio: Yes, I suppose.

SGlau: [Whispering to Chuck] What do we do now?

ChuckN: I don’t know, I don’t have a gun here.

SGlau: Well, it’s not exactly Texas.

ChuckN: Maybe we should surrender?

SGlau: We can apologise… [thinking] wait!

SGlau: [To the Mafios] Listen, we apologise for attributing all these rebuttals
to these good people. Anyway, what do you say of us becoming “Don’t be venting
- be perfecting” and help people to write essays and articles in
proper and correct English?

Head Mafio: [ He has tears in his eyes. ] Sounds very honourable, Ms. Glau.
Alright, we’ll give you two another chance.

ChuckN: Yay!

[Cut to the new office with a new sign of “Don’t be venting - be perfecting.”]

ChuckN: Finally, note that I find that the Saxon Genitive will be preferable
there.

Mikhael: [ Russian-sounding Voice from the Internet ] Thank you Mr. Norris.
I’ll be forever grateful to you two.

SGlau: You’re welcome, Mikhael. We will appreciate some publicity in social
media outlets, and a monetary payment, but we really love helping people like
you.

Mikhael: Sure, I’ll do all that.

SGlau and ChuckN: Bye! See you!

Mikhael: Good bye.

SGlau: Hmmm… I think we are actually making a profit from all that.

Head Mafio: OK, it seems you two have become benevolent pillars of
society, so not only will we let you go, but we will offer you
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_racket">protection</a>.

SGlau: Really? For how much?

Head Mafio: At half-the-price today: 5,000 virtual love points.

SGlau: Tell you what? We can give you a million real love points. [She does
a heart with her hands.]

Head Mafio: Offer accepted. Now I need to prepare for my niece’s birthday
party - she is going to be 10 years old. You two are also invited.

ChuckN: Why, thank you!

SGlau: Yes, we may actually drop by.

[<b>TODO:</b> Add:

1. "You can't touch her"/"Stop! Summer time!" by M.C. Summer (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo">M.C. Hammer’s “You can't touch this (Stop! Hammer Time!)”</a> parody).

2. “Carpe diem” song at the end -

[Kermit, ChuckN and SGlau are sitting together.]

Kermit: So, Mr. Norris, Ms. Glau, I admit things turned out better than
expected eventually.

ChuckN: Yes, Kermit, they did. Grammar Nazism are now the good guys.

Kermit: Yes, I can see that. So what are you planning to do next?

SGlau: Well, Chuck and I think of having some clean good fun with the
company of our friends. Wanna join us, Kermit?

Kermit: Sure, the muppets and I would love to.

SGlau: Excellent. Hit it, Animal.

[Animal starts playing the drums and shouts “Carpe Diem!”. SGlau opens her
jacket’s zipper to reveal a T-shirt with
<a href="https://xkcd.com/55/">the “Useless” xkcd comic</a> and they all start
singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10PBekTNXoo">“7 Minutes”
by Caitlin Hart</a>, along with Hart, the Mafios, Lucky Luke, the Grammar
Nazis, and the Head Mafio’s niece and her friends.]
