Miss Piggy: Oh, Dr. Lawrence! I am at a total loss. I am trying to lose
weight. Oh please, can you give me any diet advice?

JLaw: Of course, Miss Piggy! My approach to dieting is to eat a lot.

+++: Here: [she hands Miss Piggy a tray of Pizza] eat the whole thing.

Miss Piggy: You mean the two of us?

JLaw: No, I have my own tray. Let’s pig out.

Miss Piggy: [Angry] “Pig out”?!! No one tells moi to pig out. [Prepares her
Karate chop.]

[JLaw hits Miss Piggy repeatedly with a longbow.

Miss Piggy passes out.]

JLaw: Damn it! Such a waste of a good bowstring. Whatever. [She returns to
eating the pizza.]
