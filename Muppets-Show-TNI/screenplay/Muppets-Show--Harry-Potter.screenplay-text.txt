[ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> (=
“JKR”) is sitting among children, adults, and muppets, telling a new story. ]

JKR: Today I’m going to tell you a new story about Harry Potter and Hermione,
which happens sometimes at present. Hope you enjoy it.

[The crowd says “Yay!”.]

JKR: Harry and Herminoe were having a friendly dinner in a restaurant…

[Cut to the restaurant with Harry and Hermione (played by their original
actors) sitting and chatting.

A waitress arrives with their order.]

Waitress: [To Hermione] Here is your tea and crumpets, madame.

Hermione: Thank you! [Puts sugar in her tea , and drops her spoon to the floor.]

+++: Oh, never mind, I can use my wand. [Uses the wand to physically stir the
tea.]

Waitress: And here is your Sushi, sir.

Harry: Many thanks. I never like the chopsticks that the restaurant provides
so I think I’ll take my wand and the matching one I got from Voldermort and…
[Eats the Sushi with the two wands as chopsticks.]

JKR’s voice: And shortly after that, Harry and Hermione saw someone very much
like the late
<a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>.

[Dumbledore Two who looks like Cookie Monster with a Dumbledore-like hat
appears.]

[Harry and Hermione look at him with amazement.]

Harry & Hermione: Dumbledore?

Dumbledore Two: No, me is his successor: Dumbledore Two.

[He takes a 2-like number from behind his back. After a short while he eats
it.]

Dumbledore Two: Num num num… delicious!

Dumbledore Two: In any case, Harry, Hermione, it is your mission to fight
“He who must not be named Two”.

Harry: Really, who is he?

Dumbledore Two: His name is
<a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Amazing_Mumford">The Amazing Mumford</a>
and he is an evil dark arts’ wizard, whose magic is so awful that people are
annoyed and wish to die. You must seek and destroy him.

Hermione: I see. But why did you spell out his name if he must not be named?

Dumbledore Two: Me didn’t say who must not name him.

+++: Farewell, and good luck.

[Dumbledore Two disappears in a puff of smoke.]

The Amazing Mumford: And for my next trick, I will require a beautiful
assistant.

Harry: Mr. Mumford, I hereby propose my friend, the beautiful Hermione.

Hermione: Ahem… actually I kinda have a bad hair day today, so I think
your assistant should be the beautiful Harry (Potter!) here.

Harry: Very well, I shall be the beautiful assistant.

Miss Piggy: Stand back, Mister!

Harry: What?

Miss Piggy: I am going to be the most beautiful assistant. (She flicks her
hair.)

[Harry and Hermione look at her in amazement.]

Harry: Yes, it is obvious that this pig is the most beautiful person for
miles.

Miss Piggy: Indeed.

Song Lyrics: Everything you do, really should be done<br />
Everything you can sing, ought to be sung<br />
You can say a lot, but remember one thing,<br />
It’s easy

+++: Everything you make, was well-made,<br />
Many people in the world that you have saved,<br />
Anything you do is something that is yours and everyone's<br />
It’s easy

Chorus: Do it all with love<br />
Do it all with love<br />
Do it all with love, love<br />
Love in all you do!
