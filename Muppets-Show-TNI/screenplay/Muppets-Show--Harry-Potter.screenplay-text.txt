<s id="harry_and_hermione_s_mission" title="Harry and Hermione’s Mission">

[ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> (=
“JKR”) is sitting among children, adults, and muppets, telling a new story. ]

JKR: Today I’m going to tell you a new story about Harry Potter and Hermione,
which happens sometimes at the present day. Hope you enjoy it.

[The crowd says “Yay!”.]

JKR: Harry and Hermione were having a friendly dinner in a restaurant…

[Cut to the restaurant with Harry and Hermione (played by their original
actors) sitting and chatting.]

Harry: It’s good to meet you again here, Hermione. How’s old Ron doing?

Hermione: Oh he’s fine. How’s the Mrs.?

Harry: She’s doing fine. Things have been relatively quiet after old
<a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Riddle">Voldemort</a>’s
demise, but we ought not to rest on our Laurels.

Hermione: indeed, we should not.

[A waitress arrives with their order.]

Waitress: [To Hermione] Here is your tea and crumpets, madame.

Hermione: Thank you! [Puts sugar in her tea , and drops her spoon to the floor.]

+++: Oh, never mind, I can use my wand. [Uses the wand to physically stir the
tea.]

Waitress: And here is your Sushi, sir.

Harry: Many thanks. I never like the chopsticks that the restaurant provides
so I think I’ll take my wand and the matching one I got from Voldemort and…
[Eats the Sushi with the two wands as chopsticks.]

JKR’s voice: And shortly after that, Harry and Hermione saw someone very much
like the late
<a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>.

[Dumbledore Two who looks like <a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Cookie_Monster">Cookie Monster</a> with a Dumbledore-like hat
appears.]

[Harry and Hermione look at him with amazement.]

Harry & Hermione: Dumbledore?

Dumbledore Two: No, me is his successor: Dumbledore Two.

[He takes a “2” shape-like Styrofoam number from behind his back. After a short while, he eats
it.]

Dumbledore Two: Num num num… delicious!

Dumbledore Two: In any case, Harry, Hermione, it is your mission to fight
“He who must not be named Two”.

Harry: Really, who is he?

Dumbledore Two: His name is
<a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Amazing_Mumford">The Amazing Mumford</a>,
and he is an evil dark arts’ wizard, whose magic is so awful that people are
annoyed and wish to die. You must seek and destroy him.

Hermione: I see. But why did you spell out his name if he must not be named?

Dumbledore Two: Me didn’t say who must not name him.

+++: Farewell, and good luck.

[Dumbledore Two disappears in a puff of smoke.]

<s id="the_amazing_mumford" title="The Amazing Mumford">

[ Harry and Hermione go to see the Amazing Mumford, and notice his
stage magic is indeed awful. After the first performance, they talk to him
behind the stage, and understand that he is afraid to fail. So they tell
him that it is OK if he fails, if people don’t like him too much,
that even very experienced people fail some times, and that he should
just be himself. After that his stage magic becomes much better.

<s id="the_beautiful_assistant" title="The Beautiful Assistant">

The Amazing Mumford: And for my next trick, I will require a beautiful
assistant.

Harry: [to Hermione] That could be our chance.

Harry: Mr. Mumford, I hereby propose my friend, the beautiful Hermione.

Hermione: Ahem… actually I kinda have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N2k-gv6xNE">a bad hair day</a> today, so I think
your assistant should be the beautiful Harry (Potter!) here.

Harry: Very well, in that case, I shall be the beautiful assistant.

Miss Piggy: Stand back, Mister!

Harry: What?

Miss Piggy: I am going to be <b>the</b> most beautiful assistant. (She flicks her
hair.)

[Harry and Hermione look at her in amazement.]

Harry: Yes, it is obvious that this pig is the most beautiful person for
miles.

Miss Piggy: Indeed.

[

Spoof of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey">The miller, his son and the donkey</a> called
"The magician, his son, his daughter, and the donkey." with Hermione and Harry
Potter and with <a href="http://shrek.wikia.com/wiki/Donkey">Donkey from Shrek</a>.
]

JKR’s voice: Today I’m going to tell you an old tale - a fable - about the
Magician…

[Shows The Amazing Mumford.]

JKR’s voice: his son…

[Shows Harry Potter.]

JKR’s voice: his daughter…

[Shows Hermione.]

JKR’s voice: and their donkey.

[Shows <a href="http://shrek.wikia.com/wiki/Donkey">Donkey from Shrek</a>.]

Donkey: Yo, Let’s Go - I’m dying here.

JKR’s voice: One day they decided to go to the market to shop for some groceries. So they walked [Shows them walking.] and then ran into a few people who criticised them.

[Human-Like Muppets]

People: Look at them they have a donkey and they do not utilise it.

JKR’s voice: The Magician, his son, his daughter, and the donkey, consulted
between themselves what to do. [They huddle in a circle.]

[Harry Potter and Hermione get on Donkey, and they continue.]

Donkey: Yo, Harry, Hermione, You think it’s easy carrying you both! You’re
killing me here. That’s not the way to treat a talking donkey.

JKR’s voice: And they ran into more critics.

People: Look at it, both children ride the donkey and he’s suffering and
complaining. Oh the humanity!

JKR’s voice: Then the magician had an idea.

The Amazing Mumford: A la peanut butter sandwiches!

JKR’s voice: And the donkey turned into a big and strong stallion [similar
to the film <a href="https://shrek.fandom.com/wiki/Shrek_2">Shrek 2</a>].

Donkey: Yeah Mumma! I’m a stallion, baby!

JKR’s voice: And he had no problem carrying the son and the daughter.

+++: So they went on their way and soon met more critics.

[ They eventually summon a large part of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Cavalry">United
States Cavalry</a> for protection, as well as
<a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eagles">Eagle</a>-mounted Tolkienian
elves for aerial protection, and then arrive at the market and they all
have a good time. ]

JKR: [in the Sesame Street setting] So the moral of the story is… frankly I
have no idea! But I do know that magic is a splendid thing to have at your
disposal.

+++: And if you do not possess magic… then just try to avoid pleasing everyone.
