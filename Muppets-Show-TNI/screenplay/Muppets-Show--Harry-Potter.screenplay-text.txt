Song Lyrics: Everything you do, really should be done<br />
Everything you can sing, ought to be sung<br />
You can say a lot, but remember one thing,<br />
It’s easy

+++: Everything you make, was well-made,<br />
Many people in the world that you have saved,<br />
Anything you do is something that is yours and everyone's<br />
It’s easy

Chorus: Do it all with love<br />
Do it all with love<br />
Do it all with love, love<br />
Love in all you do!
